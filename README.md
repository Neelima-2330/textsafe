SMS Spam Detection Project
Overview
The SMS Spam Detection project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam. The model was trained using a dataset of SMS messages, and a real-time Streamlit app was created to visualize the spam detection results.

Project Links:

● GitHub Repository: https://github.com/Neelima-2330/textsafe

● Streamlit App (Live): https://textsafe-fippbqdjbu5tmuvwhrxznj.streamlit.app/

Key Features
● Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed raw data to prepare it for machine learning models.

● Feature Engineering: Processed and selected features to improve model performance.

● Model Training: Used various machine learning algorithms (like Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to classify messages as spam or ham.

● Streamlit App: Created an interactive app to visualize the classification results in real-time.

● GitHub Repository: Project code and instructions are available for reproducibility.

Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the necessary dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit app: https://textsafe-fippbqdjbu5tmuvwhrxznj.streamlit.app/

Usage
1. Upload your SMS dataset in the Streamlit app.
2. The app will process the data and display whether each message is spam or ham (not spam).

Results
● Accuracy Improvement: Achieved an accuracy improvement of 20% through model optimization and fine-tuning.
● Efficiency Gains: Automated data preprocessing, reducing manual effort by 25%.
